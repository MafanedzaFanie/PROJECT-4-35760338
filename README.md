# CMPG-323-PROJECT-4-35760338
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) &amp; Testing

## About the project
The main purpose of this project is to implement User Acceptance Testing (UAT) on a web application, a tester uses a test dataset(excel file) containing input data and desired output data. The testers then insert each input data record into each web application field and test that the desired output is generated. In this case, the desired output would be a new record being displayed on the web application once the item has been added. This would resort in a highly repetitive process which can and will (in this case) be automated using RPA.

## Prerequisites
Here is a list of all resources used to complete this project:
-	Ensure you have created a UiPath Automation Cloud account
-	Ensure that you have downloaded UiPath Studio Community Edition to your computer
-	Ensure that you are able to access the web application that you will be performing UI automation on
-	Ensure that you have retrieved the Excel file to be used as the test data

## Robot User Guide
